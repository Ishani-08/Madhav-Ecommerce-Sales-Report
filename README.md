# Madhav-Ecommerce-Sales-Report
This is an individual project using PowerBi where I have created an interactive dashboard to track and analyse the online sales data of Madhav E-Commerce with respect to various products. 

In this project I have:
  - Used various parameters to drill down into the worksheet and customize it using filters and slicers.
  - Used different types of customized visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and cards.
  - Created connections, joined tables, performed calculations to manipulate data, and enabled user-driven parameters for visualizations.
    
Using the aforementioned parameters I was able to analyse the following KPIs:
  - Total amount
  - Total profit
  - Profit/Loss by month
  - Profit by sub-category
  - Net amount by state
  - Net quantity by sub-category
